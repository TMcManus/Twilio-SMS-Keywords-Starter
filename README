====SMS Keywords with Twilio====
The goal of this script is to provide a simple, easy to understand framework for developing an SMS application that uses SMS keywords to navigate.
==Installing==
1. Download the zipped file from Github.
2. Unzip it and rename it `keywords`.
3. Upload `keywords` to a web server which can run PHP.
4. Buy an SMS enabled Twilio phone number.
5. Place the URL of `keywords.php` in the SMS Request URL for your Twilio number and save.
==Modifying the Application==
To add a new keyword, add the following to the section labeled `##Controller##`:
    function keyword(){
    	/* Any other logic you need to execute goes here. */
    	$response = new Services_Twilio_Twiml();
    	$response->sms('The text you want your keyword to show. Under 160 characters');
    	echo $response;
    }

Then add an entry to the section labeled `##Router##`:
        case 'keyword':
            keyword();
            break;
